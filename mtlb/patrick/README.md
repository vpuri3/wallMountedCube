### Cases
WMC45 - Case EP3C13 - Wall-Mounted Cube rotated 45 deg with respect to wind vector

WMC90 - Case EP3C1  - Wall-Mounted Cube with sides perpendicular to wind vector

### Coordinate System
Origin of the coordinate system is the center of the ground surface of the cube. All lengths are normalized by cube height, H.
* $$x$$ - Streamwise dir
* $$y$$ - Spanwise dir
* $$z$$ - Ground normal dir

### Inflow
$$uInflow = (z/1.0).^0.16$$

### Normalization
All velocity data is normalized by u(x=-4,y=1)
